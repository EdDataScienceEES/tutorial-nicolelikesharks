## Acknowledgements: 

A sincere thank you to Jiri and Sian for providing feedback throughout the course and for sharing this coding journey with me! We've had lots of laughs and grown so much along the way. 
I couldn't have asked for a better coding pals. Thank you to the teaching team for delivering this course and for being so patient with us as a cohort, I think we can all say that it's been
such a really fulfilling experience. Last but not least, thank you to everyone on the course for building such a supportive, safe and fun community that I had the honour to be part of. I
hope our paths cross again one day (when we all become data scientists?)
